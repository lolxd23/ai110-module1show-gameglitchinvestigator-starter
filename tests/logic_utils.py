# FIX: Collaborated with Claude to identify and fix bugs in app.py:
# - get_range_for_difficulty returned wrong range for Hard mode (1,50 instead of larger than Normal)
# - check_guess had reversed hints ("Go HIGHER" when guess was too high) and a string-vs-int
#   comparison bug on even attempts caused by secret being cast to str before the call
# - Hardcoded 1,100 ranges in the New Game button and info banner replaced with low/high variables
# Logic is scaffolded here for future refactor into logic_utils.py
